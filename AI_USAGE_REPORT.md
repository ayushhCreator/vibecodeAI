>Bolt.ai Prompt for Task B: Modern SaaS Landing Page & Component System
Project Title: VibeCode AI - Landing Page
1. Overall Project Goal & Fictional Product
You are building a stunning, modern, and production-ready landing page for a fictional SaaS product called "VibeCode".
Product: VibeCode is an AI coding assistant (like GitHub Copilot) that helps developers write better code faster, with a focus on creating beautiful UIs.
Target Audience: Frontend developers and full-stack engineers.
Key Objective: The landing page must be visually stunning, highly polished, fully responsive, and built with a reusable component architecture. The aesthetic should be inspired by industry leaders like Linear, Vercel, and Stripe.
2. Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
Language: TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Animations: Framer Motion
Code Quality: ESLint and Prettier configured out-of-the-box.
Deployment Target: Vercel
3. Design & Aesthetics (High Priority)
Theme: Dark mode by default. Include a simple light/dark mode theme toggle in the navbar.
Inspiration:
Layout & Minimalism: Linear.app
Typography & Spacing: Vercel.com
Visual Polish & Gradients: Stripe.com
Color Palette (Dark Mode):
Background: A very dark gray, almost black (e.g., #0A0A0A).
Primary Accent: A vibrant electric purple (e.g., #8B5CF6).
Text (Primary): A light gray, off-white (e.g., #E5E5E5).
Text (Secondary): A muted, medium gray (e.g., #A3A3A3).
Borders/Dividers: A semi-transparent dark gray (e.g., #262626).
Typography:
Use the Inter font family from Google Fonts.
Headlines (h1, h2): Bold, clean, and large.
Body Text: Regular weight, with generous line spacing for readability.
Visual Motifs:
Aurora/Gradient Glow: Use subtle, slow-moving radial gradients in the background of the hero section and other key areas to create depth.
Glassmorphism: Use a frosted glass effect (backdrop-filter: blur()) for the navbar and cards to create a modern feel.
Bento Grid: Use a bento-style grid for the features section.
4. Component-Based Architecture (High Priority)
Create a well-organized components directory. Inside /components, create a /ui sub-directory for generic, reusable elements.
/components/ui/Button.tsx:
A highly reusable button component.
Use cva (class-variance-authority) and tailwind-merge to handle variants.
Variants:
variant: primary (accent color background), secondary (dark gray background), outline (transparent with accent border).
size: sm, md, lg.
Should accept an optional icon.
/components/ui/Card.tsx:
A generic container card with a subtle border, rounded corners, and a slight shadow or glow on hover.
/components/ui/Accordion.tsx:
For the FAQ section. A reusable accordion component using Radix UI or built from scratch with Framer Motion for smooth open/close animations.
/components/landing/: Create specific components for each section of the landing page here (e.g., HeroSection.tsx, FeaturesSection.tsx). These will import and use the UI components.
5. Landing Page Sections (Structure from Top to Bottom)
a) Navigation Bar (/components/landing/Navbar.tsx)
Sticky: Stays at the top on scroll.
Effect: Frosted glass/blur effect.
Content (Left): "VibeCode" logo (can be text).
Content (Center): Links: "Features", "Pricing", "Docs".
Content (Right):
A "Login" link (styled as a subtle text link).
A primary Button component with the text "Get Started".
The light/dark mode theme toggle icon.
b) Hero Section (/components/landing/HeroSection.tsx)
Layout: Centered text, with a large visual element below.
Background: Subtle, slow-moving aurora gradient effect.
Headline (h1): "Build Stunning UIs, Faster than Thought."
Sub-headline: "VibeCode is your AI partner for crafting beautiful, production-ready frontend experiences. Go from prompt to pixel-perfect in seconds."
CTAs: Two Button components side-by-side.
Primary: "Start Building for Free"
Secondary: "View Demo"
Visual Element: A visually appealing, non-interactive code block component showing a simple React component being generated. Use syntax highlighting.
c) Features Section (/components/landing/FeaturesSection.tsx)
Layout: A "bento grid" of Card components of varying sizes.
Headline (h2): "The Ultimate AI Vibe for Your Workflow"
Feature Cards (6 total): Each card should have an icon, a title, and a short description.
AI-Powered Scaffolding: Generate entire components from a text prompt.
Real-time UI Preview: Instantly see the UI you are building.
Component Library Integration: Works with your existing design system.
Tailwind CSS Native: Speaks fluent Tailwind for rapid styling.
Code Refactoring: AI suggestions to improve code quality.
Automated Documentation: Generate docs for your components automatically.
d) Testimonials Section (/components/landing/TestimonialsSection.tsx)
Headline (h2): "Loved by Modern Developers"
Layout: A horizontally scrolling carousel or a 3-column grid of testimonial Cards.
Card Content: A quote, author's name, author's title, and a small profile picture. Use placeholder content.
e) Pricing Section (/components/landing/PricingSection.tsx)
Headline (h2): "Pricing That Scales With You"
Layout: A 3-tier pricing table using Card components.
Tiers:
Hobby (Free): For personal projects.
Pro ($15/mo): For professional developers (highlight this one as "Most Popular").
Team ($50/mo): For collaborative teams.
Each tier card should list 3-4 features and have a CTA Button.
f) FAQ Section (/components/landing/FAQSection.tsx)
Headline (h2): "Frequently Asked Questions"
Layout: A list of 4-5 questions using the reusable Accordion component.
g) Footer (/components/landing/Footer.tsx)
Layout: A simple grid with columns for Product links, Company links, and Social Media icons (GitHub, Twitter).
Bottom: Copyright notice © 2024 VibeCode. All rights reserved.
6. Animations & Polish (High Priority)
On-scroll Animations: Use Framer Motion's whileInView prop to have sections and cards subtly fade in and slide up as the user scrolls down.
Micro-interactions: Add subtle hover effects to all interactive elements (buttons, links, cards). A slight scale-up or glow effect is perfect.
Responsiveness: Ensure the entire page is perfectly responsive and looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:).
7. Final Deliverables
Generate the full Next.js application structure based on these instructions.
The code should be clean, well-commented (especially the component props), and formatted with Prettier.
Include a README.md with instructions on how to run the project locally and a link to the live Vercel deployment.
