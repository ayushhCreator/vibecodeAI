## 🤖 AI Tools & Services Used

### 1. **Bolt.new by StackBlitz** - Initial Project Generation
- **Platform:** https://aistudio.google.com/
- **Role:** Primary project scaffolding and initial codebase generation
- **AI Model:** Google's Gemini-powered development assistant

#### Bolt Configuration:
```json
{
  "template": "nextjs-shadcn",
  "prompt": "For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production."
}
```

#### Initial Prompt Used:
> "For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.
> 
> When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.
> 
> Do not write code that will trigger this error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"
> 
> By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.
> 
> Use icons from lucide-react for logos."

### 2. **GitHub Copilot** - Enhancement & Refinement
- **Platform:** VS Code Extension
- **Role:** Feature enhancement, bug fixes, optimization, mobile responsiveness
- **Model:** OpenAI Codex/GPT-4 based
